# ProdDMS
Production of Monte Carlo DM samples

## How to run

### Setup
I will assume that you are working at Imperial. I have tested the code on `lx03`
and `lx04`. First of all, move to a directory where you'd like to work from and
then get all the relevant code from the github repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shane-breeze/ProdDMS.git
cd ProdDMS
```
